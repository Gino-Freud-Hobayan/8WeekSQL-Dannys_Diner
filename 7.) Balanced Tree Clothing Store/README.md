## Case Study Questions
The following questions can be considered key business questions and metrics that the Balanced Tree team requires for their monthly reports.

## SQL COMMANDS:

### 1. (DDL) DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE
### 2. (DML) DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE
### 3. (DQL) DATA QUERY LANGUAGE

<br>

### We're going to skip DDL and DML since I solved this using DB Fiddle and the data is already clean.

## High Level Sales Analysis:

```sql
------------------------------------------

The division by 100 is necessary to convert the discount from a percentage (ex: 17% discount)
to a decimal before applying it to the price and quantity.
