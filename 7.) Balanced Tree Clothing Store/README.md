## Case Study Questions
The following questions can be considered key business questions and metrics that the Balanced Tree team requires for their monthly reports.

<img width="600" alt="Case Study 7 - questions" src="https://github.com/Gino-Freud-Hobayan/8WeekSQL_Challenge/assets/117270964/c0d180f0-dbeb-4e98-a9c0-2c27617035a2">

## SQL COMMANDS:

### 1. (DDL) DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE
### 2. (DML) DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE
### 3. (DQL) DATA QUERY LANGUAGE

<br>

### We're going to skip DDL and DML since I solved this using DB Fiddle and the data is already clean.

# DATA QUERY LANGUAGE (DQL):

<br><br>


## High Level Sales Analysis:

```sql
------------------------------------------
-- High Level Sales Analysis
------------------------------------------

-- 1. What was the total quantity sold for all products?

SELECT
	prod.product_id,
	prod.product_name,
	SUM(sales.qty) AS total_qty_sold

FROM
	balanced_tree.product_details AS prod
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.sales AS sales
ON prod.product_id = sales.prod_id

GROUP BY 
	prod.product_id, 
	prod.product_name
    
 ORDER BY total_qty_sold DESC



RESULT:

| product_id | product_name                     | total_qty_sold |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 9ec847     | Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens     | 3876           |
| c4a632     | Navy Oversized Jeans - Womens    | 3856           |
| 2a2353     | Blue Polo Shirt - Mens           | 3819           |

| d5e9a6     | Khaki Suit Jacket - Womens       | 3752           |
| e31d39     | Cream Relaxed Jeans - Womens     | 3707           |
| b9a74d     | White Striped Socks - Mens       | 3655           |
| c8d436     | Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens      | 3646           |

```sql
-- 2. Calculate the total generated revenue for all products before discounts

	SUM(sales.qty * sales.price) AS total_revenue_before_discount

FROM
	balanced_tree.product_details AS prod
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.sales AS sales
ON prod.product_id = sales.prod_id

GROUP BY 
	prod.product_id, 
	prod.product_name
    
 ORDER BY total_revenue_before_discount DESC
 

-- very similar to the 1st query, we just added a calculation (revenue = qty * price).

```sql
-- 3. Calculate the total discount amount for all products


SELECT

FROM
	balanced_tree.product_details AS prod

	prod.product_name
    
 ORDER BY total_discount_amount DESC
 
 
/*

qty * price * discount / 100       =    total_discount_amount


since the discount column represents the discount as a percentage (ex: 17% discount)
and we want to calculate the total discount amount in monetary values.

The division by 100 is necessary to convert the discount from a percentage (ex: 17% discount)
to a decimal before applying it to the price and quantity.
