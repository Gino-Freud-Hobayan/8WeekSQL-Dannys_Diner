8 Week SQL Challenge done by Gino Hobayan

Learning SQL, one code at a time.

I used **Microsoft SQL Server** for the 8-Week SQL Challenge, 
It's an excellent way to apply all the theoretical SQL knowledge I learned from the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

**This case study really helped me deepen my understanding of Aggregate functions, Window functions, CASE statements, CTEs, and more.**

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. 

Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
