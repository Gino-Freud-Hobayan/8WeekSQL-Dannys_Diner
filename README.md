## 8 Week SQL Challenge - https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/

SQL Case studies done by Gino Hobayan

Learning SQL, one code at a time.

This SQL Challenge is an excellent way to apply all the theoretical SQL knowledge I learned from DataCamp's SQL Fundamentals and the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

<br>

I used the following: 
<br>

- **Microsoft SQL Server** for Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner.
- **PostgreSQL** for Case Study #7 - Balanced Tree Clothing Co. (Using DB fiddle)

**This case study really helped me deepen my understanding of Aggregate functions, Window functions, CASE statements, CTEs, and more.**
